<p>This is an informatics research prototype that explores advances in <b>cloud and social computing to collect and manage Family Medical Histories</b>. The goal is to assess the possibility of moving the hosting and control of the process entirely to the patient and, in the process, enabling the connected distribution of the family history among those being described. In this experiment we'll be using versioned code hosting in GitHub and Google Code to deliver the family history application into the domain the patient's Google.com account. This experiment uses <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-25">OAUTH version 2</a> to manage the authorization workflow, such that the family history might safely aggregate, and migrate between multiple cloud providers. This is expected to be further facilitated and commodotized as <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> identifies mechanisms and standards that enable OAUTH orchestration to be assisted by the web browser. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/identity-ws/papers/idbrowser2011_submission_32.pdf">Hanes 2011</a>, for a discussion of this topic. The participated nature of the prototype is extended to the code development in order to create a computational ecosystem the patient can engage. This second design criteria seeks to support a <b>participated partnership with the biomedical facilities contributing to the patient's medical history</b>. A module loading mechanism is included that builds on earlier experiments on code integration for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/imagejs">image analysis</a> and for the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/tcga">cancer genome atlas</a>.</p>
